                            <p class="card-text" style="color:rgb(112, 53, 53);text-align: justify;">I had an amazing experience with Neeta ji! Their talent and creativity are truly exceptional. The designs were intricate, beautifully detailed, and exactly what I envisioned. They worked with such precision and patience, ensuring that every stroke was perfect.
                                Not only is their artistry top-notch, but they were also professional, punctual, and very friendly. They made the whole experience enjoyable and comfortable. The henna stain turned out rich and long-lasting, which was a huge plus!
                                If you’re looking for a skilled and reliable Mehndi artist, I highly recommend Neeta ji . I’ll definitely be booking them again for future events!</p>

                            <p class="card-text" style="color:rgb(112, 53, 53);text-align: justify;">Neeta is an incredible artist, and I was so thankful that it worked out to hire her to do my wedding mehndi. She was definitely my top choice and an easy pick among my husband's family! Her artwork is so fine, detailed, and neat- plus we loved that she did great customization on the artwork. She provided really clear instructions on what to expect during the experience (as a Type A person, this was wonderful) and how to ensure the staining went well. The mehndi came out very beautiful and lasted a long time!
                                I am so thankful that she came all the way to San Francisco to help make the first event of my wedding weekend an absolute joy. She was so wonderful to talk with for the couple of hours she was working on my artwork, and I was so impressed and in love with how the artwork turned out. She worked with me to include some special icons of my relationship- one of many details that made our wedding weekend wonderful. Our guests also loved Neeta and her team- we had so many family members get Mehndi because of how wonderful her artwork was and how fun she was to chat with. I cannot recommend her enough!!!</p>

                            <p class="card-text" style="color:rgb(112, 53, 53);text-align: justify;">Neeta Aunty is an exceptional mehndi artist! Her designs are intricate, and she’s open to collaborating on new ideas to make your bridal mehndi truly personal. Her calming and kind presence set a beautiful tone for the start of my wedding week. Neeta Aunty was so lovely and patient with my whole family, making everyone feel at ease. Her prep and aftercare instructions were extremely clear, and she even met with me for a trial to help me plan the perfect timing for my bridal session. The stain color was rich and dark and lasted throughout my wedding weekend and even into my honeymoon. Trust Neeta Aunty, she’s the best!</p>
